# TODO

- [ ] Support a list of many arguments for an option (without a fixed length). {..., args: '*'}
- [ ] Support enumerated options. Help must say something like --whatever <something|another|last>
- [ ] Support arguments suggestions when a non-supported one is detected
- [ ] Support default values for options
- [ ] Support mandatory extra args
- [ ] Create a stdio.inspect() function to inspect objects with color (maybe integrated with printf)

- [X] Add a function to print usage
- [X] Support grouped short options, like `-pnd` instead of `-p -n -d`
- [X] Make single value options more friendly (avoid usage of option.args)
- [X] Add support for mandatory arguments (throwing an error if not included)
- [X] Support mandatory options
- [X] Support large options definition using equals: --something=myvalue
- [X] Support interactive input/output, like [Y/y/n] questions.
